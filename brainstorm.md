# Brainstorm : 
- By JNN

### Basic game structure
- platformer (firegirl and waterboy inspo)
- puzzle game
- need both people to work

### Player Roles
- Idea 1: Electicy control + metal bending
    - Have metal person control metal with mouse. Lighting person, hit space to turn into lightning
    - Lightning person, can't stay lightning for too long without metal or reverting. Water instant death
    - when hard man turns to metal he becomes immovable metal, but if sparkleman comes in contact with the immovable metal they can combine and the controls merge but they become a more powerful character able to break through walls
- Idea 2: heavy and light
- Idea 3: merging into something more powerful but controls get split up (octodad vibes)
- 

### Playing functionality :
- Dual character control on the same keyboard (WASD) + (ARROW KEYS)

### Power-ups/items
- time warp (slow down/speed up)
- drunk (control drift/screen blur)
- super jump
- portal gun
- grappling hook

### Gripping Narrative
- chemistry-based game (magika type beat)
